# GoogleAppScriptsUtils

This repo contains utility scripts which have different purposes like pre-processing or cleaning a flat file before processing it or anonymizing a file with PII. 

To use these scripts, a Google App Scripts project must be created and all these files can be copied into the project and can be executed manually using any of the main*.gs files depending on the script you want to run. The current way to invoke these scripts is only through the Google App scripts console, deployment and automation possibilities need to be explored in the future.
